# Outpost Zeta: A Quake Singleplayer Map

Congratulations, soldier. 

Bold and cunning as you are, you've successfully smuggled yourself into the enemy base known as "Outpost Zeta". 

Now, once you've escaped their shipping & receiving center, you're going to have to fight your way past their defenses and push towards the very heart of the outpost, where our intelligence indicates their sinister Supersoldier program lies in wait. 

Soldier, you must shut down that program before it's too late! We're counting on you!

Do not take our enemies lately, soldier.

You must assume they have troops behind every corner.

If you want to survive, you'll have to take advantage of every resource you might find.

If we're too late to stop the program before it started, you may even need to confront the Supersoldier himself.

No doubt you'll face many battles along the way...

... But with your skills, you should be able to make it through just fine. Godspeed.
