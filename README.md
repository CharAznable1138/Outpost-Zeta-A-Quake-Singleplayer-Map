# Outpost Zeta: A Quake Singleplayer Map
"Outpost Zeta" is the working title for a Quake singleplayer map I'm creating, which will see the player conduct a raid on a mysterious, sinister military base.


The theme I have in mind is a military base, mostly grey-brown in color. To this end, I recently created a custom wad with all the textures I expect I'll need, using the id1 wad as my source. I grabbed about every texture I could find that fit the criteria of being both 1) military/tech-themed and 2) fitting nicely into a grey/brown color scheme. I made a few exceptions, namely grabbing some shoot switch textures that don't really fit the theme. I did this because I don't know of any equivalent shoot switch textures that do fit the theme and I want the option to hide easter eggs behind shoot switches. I'm also not 100% sure I'll actually use the sky, green slime or teleport textures but I want the options to have windows looking outside, toxic waste pools and/or teleport gates just in case.
