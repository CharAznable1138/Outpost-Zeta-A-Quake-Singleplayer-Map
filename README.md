# Outpost Zeta: A Quake Singleplayer Map
"Outpost Zeta" is the title of my first Quake singleplayer map, which sees the player conduct a raid on a mysterious, sinister military base.


The theme of this map is a military base, mostly grey-brown in color. To this end, I began this project by creating a custom wad with all the textures I expected to need, using the id1 wad as my source.

I then proceeded to create a bubble diagram for the purpose of planning out what became my 7 distinct areas and what kind of structure and combat flow each would entail.

After that, I elaborated on two of my planned areas in the form of simple 2D topdown maps to get a more specific idea of what each area would look like.

Then, I created the basic structure of my map in Trenchbrom using only textures from the "prototype" wad so as to keep the map relatively easy to change in this early state.

Next, I proceeded to all entities (enemies, pickups, etc.) that I planned to include until each interactive element in the whole map was complete.

Afterwards, I added proper textures and lighting to really make the map come to life. By this point, the project was nearing completion.

Finally, based on some playtesting feedback (as well as a few tests of my own), I made a few finishing touches to the map and then recorded a complete gameplay walkthrough, which can now be viewed from this very repository.
